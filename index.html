            Growing up, I always had an affinity for everything tech related. I
            was always asking how everything was done, especially video games
            inside of a computer and cellphones.
          </p>

            Committed to the idea of life-long learning, I was always a
            self-taught person. Now I am a full stack developer with a passion
            for Javascript, React, and all related to web development.
